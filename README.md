## What it Does

Allows users to add all their bank accounts and view all their transactions and spending. View by category or bank account type. A .env file is needed at the root level which is not part of the repo for obvious reasons. Test credentials for account login are shown at the bottom of the screen after you hit the `Add Account` button.
